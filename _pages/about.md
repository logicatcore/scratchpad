# Intro

My name is Sai Sharath Kakubal, I am from India and am currently pursuing my Masters course at Technische Hochschule

# Interests and skills

Having pursued Mechanical Engineering in India and having been part of designing and building a Formula Student Race 
car during my Bachelor's in a student team and having gotten opportunites to work as an Intern in a couple of companies

an elegant way.

I am also passionate about Machine Learning and A.I fields and keep myself upto date with the latest advancements in
these fields.
